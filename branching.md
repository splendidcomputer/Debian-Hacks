Below are several **small, focused tickets** that together achieve the idea of **conversation branching** for your “George-AI” RAG assistant. Each ticket is “small but detailed,” covering one major aspect or phase of the overall implementation.

---

## Ticket 1: **Conversation Branching Data Model**

**Summary**  
Introduce a new data schema to store branches of a conversation (like Git branches). Each conversation node references its parent(s), enabling multiple possible paths from the same original root.

**Scope & Tasks**

1. **Database/Storage Fields**
   - Add `branchId` or `branchName` field to each message or conversation node.
   - Add a reference to parent message(s) so we can fork a conversation at any node.
2. **API Adjustments**
   - Extend the existing create/read endpoints to accept an optional “branch reference” (like `parentMessageId`).
   - Ensure the RAG retrieval pipeline can identify which branch messages belong to.
3. **Migration or Data Update**
   - If needed, add a migration step to your existing message storage (PocketBase or other) to handle the new branching logic.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- You can store a conversation with multiple branches.
- Each branch is identified by a unique ID or “branch name” with references back to an original parent message.
- No front-end UI changes are necessary yet; just ensure the backend can store/fetch branched messages.

## Ticket 2: **Conversation Branching UI & Interaction**

**Summary**  
Implement a minimal front-end interface for branching. Let the user choose a point in the conversation to “fork” the chat, creating a new branch from that message onward.

**Scope & Tasks**

1. **UI for Forking**
   - A button or context menu item on each message saying **“Branch from here.”**
   - On click, create a new branch referencing that message.
2. **Branch Selection**
   - Let user see a dropdown (or something similar) that shows available branches for the current conversation.
   - Switch between branches to see different conversation paths.
3. **RAG Input**
   - Ensure the agent references the correct branch ID or messages from the correct branch.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- The user can fork the conversation at any message.
- The UI (dropdown or list) shows existing branches for a given root conversation.
- Switching branches updates the displayed conversation (the new chain of messages).

## Ticket 3: **Partial Chat Clearing / Redaction**

**Summary**  
Implement the ability to remove or “clear” certain messages from conversation history. This might be used to “forget” certain messages or content in a branch.

**Scope & Tasks**

1. **Per-Message Clearing**
   - In the UI, add an option to “Clear from here” or “Redact this message.”
   - The system either physically deletes or flags the message as “redacted” so the agent no longer references it.
2. **Update Branch Logic**
   - If a user redacts or removes a message that is part of a branch’s chain, handle whether subsequent messages still exist or if they get “rebased.”
   - Possibly track “cleared” messages in the DB for audit, but they do not appear in agent context.
3. **UI Indication**
   - Show a placeholder that a message was cleared or redacted.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- User can remove specific messages from a conversation (like “forget these lines”).
- The RAG pipeline no longer includes that message’s text when forming context.
- Branch references remain valid or handle rebase gracefully (depending on your design).

## Ticket 4: **Conversation Graph Visualization**

**Summary**  
Create a “Git-like” visual graph showing conversation branches. Each node is a message; branches split/fork visually.

**Scope & Tasks**

1. **Graph Data Extraction**
   - Fetch the branched messages from the backend.
   - Build a structure (like a DAG) with nodes referencing parent message IDs.
2. **Front-End Graph Rendering**
   - Use a small library or a custom D3 approach to plot each node in a connected graph.
   - Each node displays a snippet of the message or its ID.
3. **Interactivity**
   - Click on a node to jump into that branch’s conversation.
   - Possibly highlight the current “checked out” branch or main line.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- A user can open a “Conversation Graph” view to see all branches visually.
- Clicking a node or edge allows user to jump or rebase to that message.
- Graph updates if new branches are created.

## Ticket 5: **Branch Merging / Rebasing** (Optional Feature)

**Summary**  
Allow merging two branches of the conversation or “rebasing” one branch on another, akin to Git merges.

**Scope & Tasks**

1. **Select a Source & Target Branch**
   - UI or prompt to choose which conversation branch is the “destination” and which is “source.”
2. **Merge Strategy**
   - If messages differ (like conflicting instructions?), define how they’re combined or if the agent simply concatenates them.
   - Possibly note merges with a special “merge message.”
3. **Rebase**
   - Optionally let user rebase one branch on top of another so it picks up the entire conversation history.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- The user can unify or rebase two diverging conversation paths into a single new chain.
- The system updates the branched message references accordingly.
- Merged conversation is recognized by the RAG retrieval pipeline.

---

## Ticket 6: **Testing & Documentation**

**Summary**  
Test the entire conversation-branching flow—branch creation, partial clearing, and merging—across both UI and backend. Document usage for future devs.

**Scope & Tasks**

1. **Integration Tests**
   - Test “fork from message X,” “clear from message Y,” “merge branch A into B.”
   - Ensure no weird edge cases break the chain.
2. **Regression**
   - Confirm normal single-branch chat still works.
   - Confirm the agent retrieves correct context from the correct branch.
3. **Docs**
   - Provide short “Conversation Branching 101” doc: how to create branches, manage them, visualize them.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- All new branching features pass manual & integration tests.
- Clear documentation for devs and possibly end-users on how branching is used in your UI.

### Summary of Tickets

1. **Conversation Branching Data Model**
2. **Conversation Branching UI & Interaction**
3. **Partial Chat Clearing / Redaction**
4. **Conversation Graph Visualization**
5. **Branch Merging / Rebasing** (optional advanced feature)
6. **Testing & Documentation**

These tickets are **modular** and **phased**: you can tackle data model changes first, then front-end branch UI, partial clearing, the visual graph, merges, and finally testing.
