## Creating a simple Dockerfile:

1. Create a new directory for your Dockerfile and navigate into it:
    ```sh
    mkdir hello-docker
    cd hello-docker
    ```

2. Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
    ```dockerfile
    # Use the official Debian image from the Docker Hub
    FROM debian

    # Set the maintainer label
    LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com"

    # Run a command to say "Hello There!..."
    CMD ["bash", "-c", "echo 'Hello There!...'"]
    ```

3. In the same directory, open your terminal and build the Docker image with the following command:
    ```sh
    docker build -t hello-debian .
    ```

4. After the image is built, run a container using the image:
    ```sh
    docker run hello-debian
    ```

When you run the container, you should see the output:
```
Hello There!...
```

### Explanation:

- `FROM debian:latest`: This specifies the base image for your Dockerfile. In this case, it's the latest version of Debian.
- `LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com"`: This is optional but it's good practice to include metadata such as the maintainer of the Dockerfile.
- `CMD ["bash", "-c", "echo 'Hello There!...'"]`: This sets the default command to be run when a container is started from the image. Here, it runs a bash shell command to print "Hello There!...".
