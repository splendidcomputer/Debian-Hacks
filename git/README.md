# Git Documentation

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate effectively, and maintain a detailed history of their project's development. This documentation provides a reference for common Git commands and use cases, focusing primarily on the `git commit --amend` command and related operations.

## Git Amend

The `git commit --amend` command is used to modify the most recent commit. It allows you to adjust the last commit without creating a new one, making it ideal for fixing commit messages, adding or removing files, or making small content updates.

---

### Syntax

```bash
git commit --amend
```

---

### How It Works

When you run `git commit --amend`, Git:

1. Takes the currently staged changes (`git add`).
2. Combines them with the previous commit.
3. Creates a new commit object with the updated content and (optionally) an updated commit message.
4. Replaces the previous commit in the repository history.

**Note:** The old commit is replaced, not modified.

---

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Fixing the Last Commit Message

If you made a typo or need to update the last commit message:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

This opens your default text editor to modify the commit message.

#### 2. Adding Staged Changes to the Last Commit

If you forgot to include some files in your last commit:

```bash
git add <file(s)>
git commit --amend
```

#### 3. Removing Staged Changes from the Last Commit

If you accidentally included unwanted files:

```bash
git reset HEAD <file(s)>
git commit --amend
```

First, unstage the files you want to exclude, then amend the commit.

---

## Undoing the Last Commit (While Keeping Changes Staged)

If you need to undo the last commit but want to keep the changes staged:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

This command removes the commit but leaves all your changes staged, ready for editing or recommitting.

### Redoing the Last Commit

After undoing a commit with `git reset --soft`, you can redo the commit using:

```bash
git commit -c HEAD@{1}
```

- `-c HEAD@{1}` reuses the previous commit message.
- You can edit the message before completing the commit if needed.

---

## Sharing Stashed Files

Sometimes you may want to share or save your stashed changes separately.

1. To save your stash into a patch file:

```bash
git stash show -p > temp_stash.patch
```

2. To apply the saved patch later:

```bash
git apply temp_stash.patch
```

---

## Caution

- **Avoid Amending Public Commits**: Do not amend commits that have already been pushed to a shared or public repository, as it rewrites history and can cause conflicts for other collaborators.
- **Review Changes Carefully**: When amending or resetting commits, ensure that you fully understand the changes being made to avoid data loss.

---

## Conclusion

The `git commit --amend` command is a powerful tool for keeping your Git history clean and accurate. It allows you to:

- Correct mistakes.
- Update commit content.
- Improve project organization.

Use it thoughtfully, especially when working collaboratively on shared repositories.
