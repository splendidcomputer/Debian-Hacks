Git rebase and Git merge are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch to another in Git. 

Git merge is a common way to integrate the changes from one branch into another. It creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. This results in a merge commit that shows the history of both branches. 

Example of git merge:

```
git checkout master
git merge feature-branch
```

Git rebase, on the other hand, is a way to combine the changes from one branch into another by reapplying each commit from the branch being rebased on top of the target branch. This results in a linear history with all the changes from the rebased branch on top of the target branch. 

Example of git rebase:

```
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase master
```

In general, Git merge is preferred for preserving the history of a project and is a safer option for collaborating with a team. Git rebase is preferred for creating a cleaner history and avoiding unnecessary merge commits. However, it can potentially cause conflicts and rewriting history, so it should be used carefully.
