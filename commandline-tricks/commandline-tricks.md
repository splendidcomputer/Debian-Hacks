# Command Line Tricks

Here are some handy command line tricks to improve your productivity:

## 1. Reverse Search in Command History

Press `Ctrl + R` and start typing any part of a previously used command. The terminal will search through your command history and display the most recent command that matches the text you've typed.

## 2. Quickly Navigate to Home Directory

You can quickly navigate to your home directory by typing `cd` (without any arguments) and pressing `Enter`.

## 3. Repeating the Last Command

To quickly repeat the last command you executed, simply press the `Up Arrow` key followed by `Enter`.

## 4. Running Multiple Commands in One Line

You can run multiple commands in a single line by separating them with a semicolon (`;`). For example:

```bash
mkdir folder_name; cd folder_name; touch file.txt
```
